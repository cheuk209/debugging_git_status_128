The script performs two git clones for a specific purpose, ensuring proper handling of environment and application-specific configurations:

1. **First Clone (master branch - entire environment)**:
    ```yaml
    /ko-app/git-init \
    -url="..." \
    -revision="master" \
    -path="$(workspaces.output.path)/$(params.re-promotion-environment)"
    ```
    This clone retrieves the latest state of the entire environment repository. It is essential because:
    - It serves as the base where new changes will be applied.
    - A new branch is created from the master branch for the re-promotion process.
    - It contains the current ArgoCD AppSet configuration for the environment.

2. **Second Clone (specific tag - application-specific)**:
    ```yaml
    /ko-app/git-init \
    -url="..." \
    -revision="$(params.re-promote-from-tag)" \
    -path="$(workspaces.output.path)/$re_promote_from"
    ```
    This clone retrieves the version of the specific application that needs to be re-promoted. It is critical because:
    - It contains the exact version of the application manifests to be re-promoted.
    - It is used as the source for copying manifests (`cp -r ../${re_promote_from}/apps/$(params.module)/ apps/$(params.module)`).
    - It ensures precise version matching based on the specified tag.

The workflow is as follows:
1. Clone the master branch → make modifications to the environment here.
2. Clone the tagged version → copy application-specific content from here.
3. Create a new branch from the master branch.
4. Copy application manifests from the tagged version to the master branch.
5. Commit the changes and create a pull request.

This approach ensures that the re-promotion process:
- Starts from the latest state of the entire environment.
- Uses the exact version of the application manifests for consistency.
- Maintains a proper git history.

**Directory Structure Example**:
- `cr-train/` → Represents the entire environment.
- `cr-train-fe-constraint-overview-app/` → Represents the specific application within the environment directory.
