Let me explain why we need both clones with a practical example:

### Current Approach (Two Clones)
Let's say you're re-promoting version `v1.2.3` of `app-foo`:

1. **Master Branch Clone**
```
/current-env (master)
├── apps/
│   ├── app-foo/         # Current v1.1.0
│   ├── app-bar/         # v2.0.0
│   └── argocd/
│       └── appset/      # Current app configurations
└── application-environment-properties/
```

2. **Tagged Version Clone**
```
/tagged-version (v1.2.3)
├── apps/
│   └── app-foo/         # Version v1.2.3 we want to re-promote
```

### Why Not Just One Clone?
If you only cloned the tagged version (`v1.2.3`):
- You'd lose other applications' configurations in `apps/`
- You'd lose the current ArgoCD AppSet configurations
- You might overwrite environment-specific configurations
- You'd lose the Git history and branch structure

### Example of What Could Go Wrong
If you only used the tagged version:
1. `app-bar` configurations would be lost
2. ArgoCD AppSet might lose other applications' entries
3. Environment-specific overlays might be overwritten

That's why we:
1. Clone master (preserve environment state)
2. Clone specific tag (get exact version to re-promote)
3. Copy only what we need from tag to master

It's like performing surgery - you need both the patient (master branch) and the donor organ (tagged version), not just the organ alone!
