Ah, let me explain the overlay structure in Kustomize, which ArgoCD uses. Here's how it typically works:

## 📁 Typical Kustomize Structure

```plaintext
apps/
└── my-app/
    ├── base/                 # Base manifests
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── service.yaml
    │   └── kustomization.yaml
    └── overlay/
        └── env/             # Environment-specific overlays
            ├── persistent/  # Persistent configurations
            └── kustomization.yaml
```

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Base Directory** contains the core manifests:

    ```yaml
    resources:
    - deployment.yaml
    - service.yaml
    ```

2. **Overlay Directory** contains environment-specific modifications:

    ```yaml
    resources:
    - ../../base    # References the base manifests
    patchesStrategicMerge:
    - persistent/config-patch.yaml  # Environment-specific overrides
    ```

## 🔍 What ArgoCD Does

1. ArgoCD looks at `apps/{{app}}/overlay/env`.
2. Finds the `kustomization.yaml`.
3. This file:
   - References the base manifests.
   - Applies environment-specific overlays.
   - Combines everything into final manifests.

The actual manifests are in the `base` directory, while `overlay/env` contains environment-specific modifications through Kustomize.
