Already we are fixing the while loop that perpetuates the error message:

Copilot logic for avoiding endless loop (with sanitized script obvs):
 
``` Bash
# Ensure GIT_URL and GIT_PATH are defined
if [ -z "$GIT_URL" ] || [ -z "$GIT_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Error: GIT_URL or GIT_PATH is not defined. Exiting..."
    exit 1
fi

retry_count=0
until /ko-app/git-init \
    -url="$GIT_URL" \
    -revision="master" \
    -path="$GIT_URL/$GIT_PATH" \
    -sslVerify="true" -submodules="true" -depth="1"; do
    retry_count=$((retry_count+1))
    if [ $retry_count -ge 5 ]; then
        echo "Exceeded retry limit for 'master' branch. Exiting..."
        exit 1
    fi
    sleep 2
done
``` 


The error message indicates that the script is attempting to add a Git remote named `origin`, but it fails because a remote named `origin` already exists. The specific Git command being run is:

```bash
git remote add origin https://np-bitbucket.apps.np-mgmt.obpr1.eleccninp.corporg.net/scm/EFE/env-cr-training.git
```

This command is not explicitly visible in the provided script, but it is likely being executed indirectly by the `/ko-app/git-init` command. The `git-init` tool is a Tekton utility that initializes a Git repository, clones it, and sets up remotes. By default, it attempts to add a remote named `origin` to the repository.

The error occurs because the repository already has a remote named `origin`. To resolve this, you can modify the script to check if the remote `origin` already exists before running `git-init`. Alternatively, you can remove the existing remote or use a different remote name.

For example, you can add a check before running `git-init`:

```bash
if git remote | grep -q origin; then
  git remote remove origin
fi
```

This ensures that the `origin` remote is removed if it already exists, preventing the error.


I'll break down the bash script into logical sections that can be separated into different Tekton Task steps:

1. Initialize Environment (Setup Step)
2. Clone Repositories (Clone Step)
3. Branch Creation (Branch Step)
4. ArgoCD AppSet Update (ArgoCD Step)
5. Application Manifests Management (Manifest Step)
6. Environment Properties Management (Properties Step)
7. Persistent Environment Overlay (Overlay Step)
8. Git Operations (Git Commit Step)
9. Push Changes (Push Step)
Each of these sections can become a separate Task step in Tekton. They should be executed in sequence as they have dependencies on each other. Each step would need:

The workspace mount point
Relevant environment variables
Appropriate container image with required tools
Error handling and retry logic where necessary
